# App Overview
This is my first app using mongoose package and handling data from mongodb and log it in to the console.
# How to use
To use an application, first you need to make sure you have access to local mongo database "test" and "persons" collection. Next you should download the repo, go to project directory, type command "npm i" to install all dependencies and in the same place type command "node index.js" to start server. Last step is typing in browser url "localhost:3000" and you can use an application.
